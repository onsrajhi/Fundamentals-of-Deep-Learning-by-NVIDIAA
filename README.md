This repository documents my hands-on journey through a transformative deep learning course. From image classification to natural language processing, I've tackled real-world problems using powerful tools and frameworks in AI.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course offered a structured pathway into deep learning through project-based learning:

### 🧠 Part 1: Image Classification & CNNs
- Datasets: MNIST, American Sign Language (ASL)
- Techniques:
  - Basic neural network models
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Data augmentation
  - Model evaluation & optimization

### 🔄 Part 2: Transfer Learning & Deployment
- Pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, VGG, ResNet)
- Fine-tuning on custom datasets
- Achieving high accuracy with limited data
- Exporting models for production (e.g., `.h5`, `SavedModel`)
- Deployment in real-world environments
